<p>Recently, I did myself a favor and bought a little <a href="https://www.amazon.com/-/de/dp/B0D6G36LVK/?th=1">Beelink SER5 Pro Mini PC</a> a home server to run some services I use on my home network and also to run some development containers.</p>
<p>With this shiny new home server, I also wanted to set up some offsite backups for it. I <a href="https://social.tchncs.de/@oliverandrich/113809850827095296">asked</a> on Mastodon for suggestions and got tips to use <a href="https://www.borgbackup.org/">borgbackup</a> and <a href="https://restic.net/">restic</a>. Both are reasonable suggestions with great documentation.</p>
<p>After some research, I decided to go with restic and <a href="https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/">resticprofile</a>. The deciding factor was that Hetzner, whose new <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/storage/object-storage/">S3-compatible object storage</a> I wanted to use, had a <a href="https://docs.hetzner.com/storage/object-storage/howto-backups/restic">documentation for using restic</a>.</p>
<h3 id="installing-restic-and-resticprofile">Installing restic and resticprofile</h3>
<p>I run Debian Bookworm on my home server, so the installation of restic was pretty easy with <strong>apt install restic</strong>. To install resticprofile, I used the <a href="https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/installation/linux/index.html">guide for linux</a> and ran the following commands:</p>
<pre><code>curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creativeprojects/resticprofile/master/install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
sudo ./install.sh -b /usr/local/bin
</code></pre>
<h3 id="configuring-backups">Configuring backups</h3>
<p>First off, I had to configure <a href="https://docs.hetzner.com/storage/object-storage/getting-started/generating-s3-keys/">S3 credentials</a> and set up a <a href="https://docs.hetzner.com/storage/object-storage/getting-started/creating-a-bucket/">S3 bucket</a> on the Hetzner cloud.</p>
<p>Depending on the location chosen, the endpoint is one of</p>
<ul>
<li>fsn1.your-objectstorage.com (Falkenstein)</li>
<li>nbg1.your-objectstorage.com (Nuremberg)</li>
<li>hel1.your-objectstorage.com (Helsinki)</li>
</ul>
<p>My server has just a small 500 GB SSD disk so far, so I decided to go with a single backup configuration that backups the whole device with some exceptions. The backup is scheduled at midnight and the cleanup process at half past midnight.</p>
<p>The configuration file is pretty straightforward and easy. I placed it in the one of the default locations <strong>/usr/local/etc/resticprofile/profiles.yaml</strong>.</p>
<pre><code># yaml-language-server: $schema=https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/jsonschema/config-1.json

version: '1'

default:
  repository: 's3:https://&lt;Endpoint of the bucket&gt;/&lt;Name of the S3 Bucket&gt;'
  initialize: true
  env:
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: &lt;Your Access Key&gt;
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: &lt;Your Secret Key&gt;
    RESTIC_PASSWORD: &lt;Some long and cryptic string&gt;
  backup:
    source:
      - /
    exclude:
      - /dev
      - /media
      - /mnt
      - /proc
      - /run
      - /sys
      - /tmp
      - /var/cache
      - /var/lib/docker
      - .cache
    schedule-permission: system
    schedule-log: &quot;/var/log/resticprofile/homeserver-backup.log&quot;
    # Every day at midnight
    schedule: &quot;*-*-* 00:00:00&quot;
  forget:
    # Keep the last 10 snapshots
    keep-last: 10
    prune: true
    schedule-permission: system
    schedule-log: &quot;/var/log/resticprofile/homeserver-forget.log&quot;
    # Every day at half past midnight
    schedule: &quot;*-*-* 00:30:00&quot;
</code></pre>
<h3 id="initialize-and-do-your-first-backup">Initialize and do your first backup</h3>
<p>To do the initialization of the repository and run my first backup, I had to call the following two commands.</p>
<pre><code>resticprofile init
resticprofile backup 
</code></pre>
<h3 id="scheduling-backups">Scheduling backups</h3>
<p>Finally, a lazy guy like me wants a regular process for his backup. resticprofile has a handy command to install a scheduler for me that obeys the rules configured in the <code>profiles.yaml</code> above.</p>
<pre><code>resticprofile schedule
</code></pre>
<p>Done!</p>

			 <p>Pretty happy how everything works in this micro.blog. The only thing I have to make up my mind about is, whether I want to use automatic cross posting or not. But the backup to github doesn&rsquo;t seem to work at all. Not sure what I did wrong about it.</p>

			 <p>This has been the last week of my three-week-long winter holidays. A vacation I needed more than I needed any vacation in the last few years. The second half of 2024 was so packed and stressful. I had many plans for this vacation, but eventually, I just relaxed, watched TV, read three books, played some Xbox and spent some calm days with my wife.</p>
<p>Something that I haven’t written about is, that I have been <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/minutes/2024/dec/10/dsf-board-monthly-meeting/">approved as an individual member</a> of the Django Software Foundation in December. This is something I am a bit proud of.</p>
<p>As a side note, here you can see one of my two new year resolutions in effect. I want to turn writing week notes and blogging in general into a habit. Wish me luck.</p>

<p>I use <a href="https://todoist.com/">Todoist</a> as my task list application for a while now. Before that, I have used <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a> by Cultured Code. I had to leave Things behind because it is still lacking the ability to share to-do list with other users. But one feature I have missed from Things all the time — the Things helper. This is a small add-on that registers a global shortcut, that creates tasks for E-Mails or links in Safari or Chrome.</p>
<p>I got the inspiration from a friend to reimplement it using <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com">Alfred</a>, my primary shortcut and productivity driver on my Mac. And it was way easier than I thought.</p>
<h3 id="features">Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Register CMD+Shift+Space as a global short to create new tasks. If neither Mail nor Safari is the front most application, the standard quick add dialog from Todoist is opened.</li>
<li>Register some keywords to open certain views from Alfred.
<ul>
<li>“today” and “heute” to open the today view.</li>
<li>“inbox” and “eingang” to open the inbox view.</li>
<li>“upcoming” and “geplant” to open the upcoming view.</li>
</ul>

			 <p>Since Matt started his crazy little campaign at the end of the last year, I had the desire to get rid of WordPress and move elsewhere. First, I thought a bit about using Hugo or so. But this was too much work for my little, low-volume blog. And I also wanted a service that lets me post from my browser and while I am using my mobile. It should be simple, too. Micro.blog is a natural choice then.</p>
<p>The transition from WordPress was super easy. I set up my blog and followed the instructions from the help section covering the <a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/wordpress-import/55">WordPress import</a>.</p>
<h3 id="lessons-learned-during-my-first-attempt">Lessons learned during my first attempt</h3>
<ul>
<li>Every tag and category is mapped to a category in here. Bad, because I didn&rsquo;t want 100+ categories on my new blog.</li>
<li>The process takes some time, even though I had the impression that it was finished quickly. This caused me to start the process with different exports several times. Afterward I had every post many times in my post list, every image was imported many times too, and I ended up with a total mess.</li>
<li>The post-only export doesn&rsquo;t seem to work. You have to export the complete WordPress content for the import process to succeed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Having to delete 100 posts and 200 images one by one let me prepare my second attempt a bit better.</p>
<h3 id="my-second-attempt">My second attempt</h3>
<p>Before, I did the following on the WordPress side:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deleted all tags and categories I would rather not see in micro.blog.</li>
<li>Deleted posts that I didn&rsquo;t want to migrate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then I did a complete export, did one import and everything worked like a charm.</p>
<p>In the end, I only migrated 8 posts from the 28 on WordPress. Most of them just worked after the import, I only had to fix all the code blocks because I used a somewhat obscure code block plugin on WordPress.</p>
<p>Now I am here and satisfied with the results. The tweaking of the theme was easy from my perspective. The backend is simple and just works. The only annoyance I have seen so far, the editor automatically reloads occasionally, which made me finish this post in an external editor. I have to investigate if this is a feature, a problem with my browser or something else. Maybe it is also an option to use a client like MarsEdit or Ulysses.</p>
