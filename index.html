		<a href="https://andrich.me/2025/01/20/ideas-how-to-support-tailwind.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2025-01-20 22:50:58 &#43;0100">Jan 20, 2025</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><a href="https://tailwindcss.com">Tailwind CSS</a> released its <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/v4-beta">first beta</a> version at the end of November of last year. Since then, I have been thinking about how to implement the changes in the Django library <a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-tailwind-cli/">django-tailwind-cli</a>.</p>
<p>Tailwind CSS 4.0 includes some interesting and substantial changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of a tailwind.config.js file, you can configure all of your customizations directly in the CSS file where you import Tailwind.</li>
<li>Automatic source detection.</li>
<li>Simplified theme configuration and CSS-first configuration make a lot of customization steps that I normally add to <code>tailwind.config.js</code> obsolete, as they just work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even though the new version still supports configuring the library using a <code>tailwind.config.js</code>, I think about introducing some backward incompatible changes for changes.</p>
<ul>
<li>The versioning follows the Tailwind CSS library, which means the next release will be 4.×.</li>
<li>The management sub command <code>list_templates</code> is removed.</li>
<li>The configuration variable <code>TAILWIND_CLI_CONFIG_FILE</code> is removed.</li>
<li><code>TAILWIND_CLI_SRC_CSS</code> is changed into a required configuration variable with a sane default.</li>
<li>I am also considering merging the <code>runserver</code> and <code>runserver_plus</code> management commands into a single <code>runserver</code>command, that has the functionality of the <code>runserver_plus</code> command. I am still not sure if I want to turn <code>django-extensions</code> from an optional into a required dependency.</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, I am still not sure how to implement the transition. It can be a hard and manual one, or I can try to implement some kind of migration code. The latter is a lot of work and might not work in all situations. The former requires extra work for the users.</p>
<p>Your feedback is welcome. Leave a comment or write me a message on Mastodon or an email.</p>

			 <p>This was the first workweek of 2025. A packed week that felt like I was on a high-speed circuit. Jumping back and forth between five active projects, where I have different roles. Hacked a lot of Python and Django for one project. Did a lot of consulting on another project. Long days, but somehow this all felt excellent and I felt alive. It kicked me out of my winter vacation lethargy.</p>

<p>I finished the <a href="https://www.cross-cult.de/produkte/details/star-trek-zeit-des-wandels-1-geburt/">first book of the Star Trek - Zeit des Wandels</a> series and started to read <a href="https://www.cross-cult.de/produkte/details/ebook-star-trek-zeit-des-wandels-2-tod/">the second book</a>. It is a wonderful series. Totally in tone with the Star Trek universe. It contains many references to The Next Generation and connects to some unfinished stories and plots.</p>
<p>The artificial intelligence book by Inga Strümke was a great read too. Now I started to re-read <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/fluent-python-2nd/9781492056348/">Fluent Python</a>. This is the one Python book that I re-read over and over again. I always learn something new or refresh my knowledge.</p>
<p>Next I plan to read the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivers_of_London_(book_series)">Rivers of London</a> series. I only read one book some years ago, and really liked it. Sadly, I didn’t continue with it. This time I will read them in English.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://andrich.me/2025/01/11/backup-for-my-home-server.html">Backup for my home server with restic and resticprofile</a></h1>

<p>Recently, I did myself a favor and bought a little <a href="https://www.amazon.com/-/de/dp/B0D6G36LVK/?th=1">Beelink SER5 Pro Mini PC</a> a home server to run some services I use on my home network and also to run some development containers.</p>
<p>With this shiny new home server, I also wanted to set up some offsite backups for it. I <a href="https://social.tchncs.de/@oliverandrich/113809850827095296">asked</a> on Mastodon for suggestions and got tips to use <a href="https://www.borgbackup.org/">borgbackup</a> and <a href="https://restic.net/">restic</a>. Both are reasonable suggestions with great documentation.</p>
<p>After some research, I decided to go with restic and <a href="https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/">resticprofile</a>. The deciding factor was that Hetzner, whose new <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/storage/object-storage/">S3-compatible object storage</a> I wanted to use, had a <a href="https://docs.hetzner.com/storage/object-storage/howto-backups/restic">documentation for using restic</a>.</p>
<h3 id="installing-restic-and-resticprofile">Installing restic and resticprofile</h3>
<p>I run Debian Bookworm on my home server, so the installation of restic was pretty easy with <strong>apt install restic</strong>. To install resticprofile, I used the <a href="https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/installation/linux/index.html">guide for linux</a> and ran the following commands:</p>
<pre><code>curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creativeprojects/resticprofile/master/install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
sudo ./install.sh -b /usr/local/bin
</code></pre>
<h3 id="configuring-backups">Configuring backups</h3>
<p>First off, I had to configure <a href="https://docs.hetzner.com/storage/object-storage/getting-started/generating-s3-keys/">S3 credentials</a> and set up a <a href="https://docs.hetzner.com/storage/object-storage/getting-started/creating-a-bucket/">S3 bucket</a> on the Hetzner cloud.</p>
<p>Depending on the location chosen, the endpoint is one of</p>
<ul>
<li>fsn1.your-objectstorage.com (Falkenstein)</li>
<li>nbg1.your-objectstorage.com (Nuremberg)</li>
<li>hel1.your-objectstorage.com (Helsinki)</li>
</ul>
<p>My server has just a small 500 GB SSD disk so far, so I decided to go with a single backup configuration that backups the whole device with some exceptions. The backup is scheduled at midnight and the cleanup process at half past midnight.</p>
<p>The configuration file is pretty straightforward and easy. I placed it in the one of the default locations <strong>/usr/local/etc/resticprofile/profiles.yaml</strong>.</p>
<pre><code># yaml-language-server: $schema=https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/jsonschema/config-1.json

version: '1'

default:
  repository: 's3:https://&lt;Endpoint of the bucket&gt;/&lt;Name of the S3 Bucket&gt;'
  initialize: true
  env:
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: &lt;Your Access Key&gt;
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: &lt;Your Secret Key&gt;
    RESTIC_PASSWORD: &lt;Some long and cryptic string&gt;
  backup:
    source:
      - /
    exclude:
      - /dev
      - /media
      - /mnt
      - /proc
      - /run
      - /sys
      - /tmp
      - /var/cache
      - /var/lib/docker
      - .cache
    schedule-permission: system
    schedule-log: &quot;/var/log/resticprofile/homeserver-backup.log&quot;
    # Every day at midnight
    schedule: &quot;*-*-* 00:00:00&quot;
  forget:
    # Keep the last 10 snapshots
    keep-last: 10
    prune: true
    schedule-permission: system
    schedule-log: &quot;/var/log/resticprofile/homeserver-forget.log&quot;
    # Every day at half past midnight
    schedule: &quot;*-*-* 00:30:00&quot;
</code></pre>
<h3 id="initialize-and-do-your-first-backup">Initialize and do your first backup</h3>
<p>To do the initialization of the repository and run my first backup, I had to call the following two commands.</p>
<pre><code>resticprofile init
resticprofile backup 
</code></pre>
<h3 id="scheduling-backups">Scheduling backups</h3>
<p>Finally, a lazy guy like me wants a regular process for his backup. resticprofile has a handy command to install a scheduler for me that obeys the rules configured in the <code>profiles.yaml</code> above.</p>
<pre><code>resticprofile schedule
</code></pre>
<p>Done!</p>

			 <p>This has been the last week of my three-week-long winter holidays. A vacation I needed more than I needed any vacation in the last few years. The second half of 2024 was so packed and stressful. I had many plans for this vacation, but eventually, I just relaxed, watched TV, read three books, played some Xbox and spent some calm days with my wife.</p>

<p>I use <a href="https://todoist.com/">Todoist</a> as my task list application for a while now. Before that, I have used <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a> by Cultured Code. I had to leave Things behind because it is still lacking the ability to share to-do list with other users. But one feature I have missed from Things all the time — the Things helper. This is a small add-on that registers a global shortcut, that creates tasks for E-Mails or links in Safari or Chrome.</p>
<p>I got the inspiration from a friend to reimplement it using <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com">Alfred</a>, my primary shortcut and productivity driver on my Mac. And it was way easier than I thought.</p>
<h3 id="features">Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Register CMD+Shift+Space as a global short to create new tasks. If neither Mail nor Safari is the front most application, the standard quick add dialog from Todoist is opened.</li>
<li>Register some keywords to open certain views from Alfred.
<ul>
<li>“today” and “heute” to open the today view.</li>
<li>“inbox” and “eingang” to open the inbox view.</li>
<li>“upcoming” and “geplant” to open the upcoming view.</li>

			 <p>Since Matt started his crazy little campaign at the end of the last year, I had the desire to get rid of WordPress and move elsewhere. First, I thought a bit about using Hugo or so. But this was too much work for my little, low-volume blog. And I also wanted a service that lets me post from my browser and while I am using my mobile. It should be simple, too. Micro.blog is a natural choice then.</p>
<p>The transition from WordPress was super easy. I set up my blog and followed the instructions from the help section covering the <a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/wordpress-import/55">WordPress import</a>.</p>
<h3 id="lessons-learned-during-my-first-attempt">Lessons learned during my first attempt</h3>
<ul>
<li>Every tag and category is mapped to a category in here. Bad, because I didn&rsquo;t want 100+ categories on my new blog.</li>
<li>The process takes some time, even though I had the impression that it was finished quickly. This caused me to start the process with different exports several times. Afterward I had every post many times in my post list, every image was imported many times too, and I ended up with a total mess.</li>
<li>The post-only export doesn&rsquo;t seem to work. You have to export the complete WordPress content for the import process to succeed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Having to delete 100 posts and 200 images one by one let me prepare my second attempt a bit better.</p>
<h3 id="my-second-attempt">My second attempt</h3>
<p>Before, I did the following on the WordPress side:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deleted all tags and categories I would rather not see in micro.blog.</li>
<li>Deleted posts that I didn&rsquo;t want to migrate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then I did a complete export, did one import and everything worked like a charm.</p>
<p>In the end, I only migrated 8 posts from the 28 on WordPress. Most of them just worked after the import, I only had to fix all the code blocks because I used a somewhat obscure code block plugin on WordPress.</p>
<p>Now I am here and satisfied with the results. The tweaking of the theme was easy from my perspective. The backend is simple and just works. The only annoyance I have seen so far, the editor automatically reloads occasionally, which made me finish this post in an external editor. I have to investigate if this is a feature, a problem with my browser or something else. Maybe it is also an option to use a client like MarsEdit or Ulysses.</p>
